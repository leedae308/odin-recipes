TOP Foundation Course

Skills Learned from TOP so far: Git, HTML
    HTML: Links, different headers, lists, pictures.

This uses all the skills listed above to create a HTML based recipe book.
The css part will be added in the future.



*CSS part has been added on 25-02-09.
After learning about CSS, a style has been added onto each section of the recipe book.
I tried to keep all the style same through the recipe section.
